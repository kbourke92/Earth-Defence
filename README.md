# Earth Defence
Take up arms and fight! You are the last ace pilot left in the Earth Defence Armada. Aliens are attacking and you must eliminate as many as possible while you have health.

## Features

### Landing Page
Upon arrival you will be presented with the current situation, a reminder on how to fly your ship and to grab health as much as you can. The aliens are ceaseless.

### Game area
This is your battlefield! Don't stop firing until your last breath. The aliens will keep coming along with lots of health kits. Due to the alien mist covering earth your health will keep falling. When your health reaches zero its game over. The aliens have won.

### Game Over 
Upon death you will be shown your score and the option to revive and try again. This also includes a motivational message to give you strength.

- Localised storage so fighters can save their progress
- A heart system so fighters can have multiple lives before it is game over.
